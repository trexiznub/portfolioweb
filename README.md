Created a personal portfolio using tailwind css 
I developed a personal portfolio website using Tailwind CSS and HTML, designed to effectively showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The site features a clean and modern interface, with a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. By leveraging Tailwind's utility-first framework, I was able to create custom, scalable styling that enhances the visual appeal while maintaining high performance. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive representation of my work as a developer, offering an engaging and accessible experience for potential employers and collaborators alike.
